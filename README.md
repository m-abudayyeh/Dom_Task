# JavaScript DOM and Array Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates two tasks using JavaScript:

1. Adding images to a list of fruits in the DOM.
2. Finding the index of a given number in an array.

## Task 1: Adding Images to the DOM

### Description:
This task involves using JavaScript to dynamically add images of fruits to an unordered list (`ul`). Each fruit is represented by an object in an array, with its name and image source.
